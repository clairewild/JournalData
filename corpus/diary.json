I hope \nshell know why I really did it. Of course she'll \ngo and sneak to Mother. Let her. What right has \nshe to call me child. She's got a fine red scratch any- \nhow, and on her right hand where everyone can see.",

  "text" : "July 27 th. There's such a lot of fruit here. I \neat raspberries and gooseberries all day and Mother \nsays that is why I have no appetite for dinner. But \nDr. Klein always says Fruit is so wholesome. But \nwhy should it be unwholesome all at once? Hella \nalways says that when one likes anything awfully \nmuch one is always scolded about it until one gets \nperfectly sick of it. Hella often gets in such a temper \nwith her mother » and then her mother says: We \nmake such sacrifices for our children and they reward \nus with ingratitude. I should like to know what \nsacrifices they make. I think it's the children who \nmake the sacrifices. When I want to eat gooseberries \nand am not allowed to, the sacrifice is mine not \nMother^s. I've written all this to Hella. FriLulein \nPriickl has written to me. The address on her letter \nto me was splendid^ 'Traulein Grete Lainer, Lyzeal- \nschiilerin.\" Of course Dora had to know better than \nanyone else, and said that in the higher classes from \nthe fourth upwards (because she is in the fourth) \nthey write \"Lyzeistin.\" She said: \"Anyhow, in the \nholidays, before a girl has attended the first class \nshe's not a Lyzealschiilerin at all.\" Then Father \nchipped in, saying that we (I didn't begin it) really \nmust stop this eternal wrangling; he really could \nnot stand it. He's quite right, but what he said \nwon't do any good, for Dora will go on just the same. \nFnlulein Priickl wrote that she was ddigkted that I \nhad written. As soon as I have time she wants me \nto write to her again. Great Scott, I've always time \nfor her. I shall write to her again this evening after \nsupper, so as not to keep her waiting.",

  "text" : "July 31st. Yesterday was heavenly. We laughed \ntill our sides ached over Consequences. I was always \nbeing coupled with Robert and oh the things we did \ntogether, not really of course but only in writing: \nkissed, hugged, lost in the forest, batibed together; \nbut I say, I wouldn't do that! quarrelled. That \nwon't happen, it's quite impossible! Then we drank \nmy health clinking glasses five times and Robert \nwanted to drink it in wine but Dora said that would \nnever do! The real trouble was this. She always \ngets furious if she has to play second fiddle to me \nand yesterday I was certaiidy first fiddle. \n\nNow I must write a word about to-day. WeVe \nhad a splendid time. We were in Tief engraben with \nthe Warths where there are such a lot of wild straw- \nberries. Robert picked all the best of them for me, \nto the great annoyance of Dora who had to pick \nthem for herself. Really I would rather pick them for \nmyself, but when some one else picks them for one \nfor lave (that's what Robert said) then one is quite \nglad to have them picked for one. Besides, I did \npick some myself and gave most of them to Father \nand some to Mother. At afternoon tea which we \nhad in Flischberg I had to sit beside Ema instead \nof Robert. Ema is rather dull. Mother says she is \nanemic; that sounds frightfully interesting, but I \ndon't quite know what it means. Dora is always \nsaying that she is anemic, but of course that is not \ntrue. And Father always says \"Don't talk such stuff, \nyou're as fit as a fiddle.\" That puts her in such a \nwax. Last year Lizzi was really anemic, so the doctor \nsaid, she was always having palpitation and had to \ntake iron and drink Burgxmdy. I think that's where \nDora got the idea. \n\nAugust 1st Hella is rather cross with me because \nI wrote and told her that I had spent the whole day \nwith the W's. Still, she is really my only friend or \nI should not have written and told her. Every year \nin the country she has another friend too, but that \ndoesn't put me out. I can't understand why she \ndoesn't like Robert; she doesn't know anything about \nhim except what I have written and certainly that \nwas nothing but good. Of course she does know him \nfor he is a cousin of the Semigs and she met him once \nthere. But one does not get to know a person from \nseeing them once. Anyhow she does not know him \nthe way I do. Yesterday I was with the Warths \nall day. We played Place for the King and Robert \ncaught me and I had to give him a kiss. And Ema \nsaid, that doesn't count, for I had let myself be caught. \nBut Robert got savage and said: Ema is a perfect \nnuisance, she spoils everyone's pleasure. He's quite \nright, but there's some one else just as bad. But I \ndo hope Ema has not told Dora about the kiss. If \nshe has everyone will know and I shouldn't like that. \nI lay in wait for Ema with the sweets which Aunt \nDora sent us. Robert and Liesel and I ate the rest. \nThey were so good and nearly all large ones. At \nfirst Robert wanted to take quite a little one, but \nI said he must only have a big one. After that he \nalways picked out tiie big ones. When I came home \nin the evening with the empty box Father laughed \nand said: There's nothing mean about our Gretel. \nBesides, Mother still has a great box full ; I have no \nidea whether Dora still has a lot, but I expect so.",
